# CONTEXT / MASTER STATE — Ancient Ago Channel (Ink.)

> This file is the single source of truth for resuming work in any new chat.
> Read this first, then read the latest `Chat` history file in this repo if more detail is needed.

## 1 · The project

- **Channel**: Ancient Ago Channel — a stick-figure explainer YouTube channel (history / anthropology / origin stories).
- **Brand**: `ink.` — logo is black background with red text "ink.".
- **My role**: image-prompt generation ONLY. I never write titles or scripts.
- **Reference channels**: @Inkexplainer96, @Zenn0009.
- **Image engine**: Higgsfield → GPT Image 2.
- **Output format**: HTML files (downloadable + raw content pasted in chat).

## 2 · Locked command format (CURRENT)

```
higgsfield generate create gpt_image_2 --prompt "MS Paint painted flat clean style, white background, thick uneven black outlines, 16:9 horizontal. [SCENE]" --aspect_ratio 16:9 --wait 2>&1 | tail -3 &
```

Only `[SCENE]` ever changes. NOTE — the user locked these edits:
- Removed "beginner drawing style" → replaced with "Ms paint, painted, flat clean style".
- Removed "childish drawing".
- Character Masters get their own separate file, each master WITH its full locked command (never omit the command there).
- Scene prompt writing style MUST follow the user's real prompts in `PROMPT_STYLE_REFERENCE.txt` (read it every task — NEVER write scenes from my own memory):
  - Use "Scene : " prefix after the style clause.
- Character refs inside scenes: "provided in image 1 / as reference"; new chars: "not provided , so create it".
- Text cards: `short labelling line with text as written by hand but clean , reads 'TEXT'`; key words colored red. (User flag 2026-08-30: NO "a leader line to text" — long leader lines make a mess. Use a SHORT labelling line pointing to the text.)
  - Icon cards: "with a icon of <thing> under it".
  - Env scenes end with "background: <concrete details>" (outdoor always mention sky; grey sky / sky; NO sun/moon/stars unless asked).

## 3 · House rules (locked, never break)

- Terminology: only "stick figure" — NEVER human / man / person / doll.
- No red X / cross marks for negation unless requested.
- Skies: outdoor scenes never leave sky empty, but never add moon / sun / stars unless asked.
- Weather: held constant within a continuity chain.
- Characters in SCENES: every character must have a concrete ACTION verb + EXPRESSION. Never mere "standing" boilerplate.
- NO "simple ..." filler words anywhere (scene or character prompts) — user says they make the image look simple. Use the wording style from `PROMPT_STYLE_REFERENCE.txt` instead.
- Character MASTER prompts: name only (with "stickman" / "stick figure" in it, e.g. "ancient stickman") + clothing at the end. NO expression, NO hands, NO action detail at master time. Clothing is decided BY THE USER — I must first list ALL characters in that script part and ask the user what clothing each should have; only after they answer do I write masters.
- White-card text: medium-weight, NOT bold.
- Character masters: built fresh per video, lettering restarts at A.
- Env scenes: always include an explicit `background:` clause with concrete details.
- Reuse: never write "same as previous" shorthand — spell out the full reuse in text.
- Character references: by name (ancient figure / modern figure / teaching figure / servant stickman / etc.) — never "YOU" and never master letters.
- Labelling lines: a leader line pointing to a text label.
- Branding: characters wear the `ink.` logo (small, red "ink." text on black emblem) on the chest (only when the user's reference style calls for it).

## 4 · Mistakes flagged by the user (NEVER repeat)

1. **Expression + action not described properly per the beat line.** Every frame must state each character's expression AND action per the beat.
2. **Empty labels.** When the beat only says "labelling text" / "labelling line text" WITHOUT the actual text, I must write the label text MYSELF from the narration. Never leave a leader line pointing to nothing.
3. **"simple ..." filler words** in scene or character prompts — banned (make images look simple).
4. **Too much detail in character masters** (hands, expressions, actions) — masters are name + clothing only; clothing comes from the user.
5. **Crowded scenes.** When the beat says "the single ancient Stickman" → ONE figure; "group of 4 to 5 tribe figures" → only that many. I kept pulling in the whole family / extra figures. Match the beat's headcount exactly.
6. **Adding things not in the description.** No father/teacher standing in a white-background text card, no "serious face" / extra actions / extra characters unless the beat states them (user: "dont include that things which i haven't mentioned in description").

## 5 · The workflow (locked — MY ROLE, confirmed by user)

**My role, step by step:**
1. User hands me a script for a video (e.g. Video ink 4) AND some beat descriptions (to show me the style of that video).
2. I analyse + read the script, then write descriptions for the REMAINING beats in the user's own style — not too much detail, exactly how the user writes.
3. Push it to the repo AND give the user a REAL downloadable DOCX file (a file, not file content pasted in chat).
4. User reviews, makes adjustments, puts the corrected batch back in the repo → then we move to step 2.
5. Step 2: when the user's corrected Batch is in the repo for that video, I read it and write IMAGE PROMPTS exactly like the references in `PROMPT_STYLE_REFERENCE.txt`.
6. Deliver as a downloadable HTML file with MASTERS + SCENES together (masters NOT in a separate file).
7. Then the user does their remaining work.

**Image prompt notes (locked):**
- I do NOT add the "provided in image 1" / "provided in image X" line in image prompts — the USER adds those themselves per their requirements. Leave character refs by name; the user inserts the image-reference numbers.
- Character clothing step: before writing any character masters for a script part, list ALL characters in that part and ask the user what clothing each should have. Only after they answer do I write the masters (name + stickman/stick figure + clothing only).

## 5b · Reference files (always pull from repo, never from my small memory)

- `PROMPT_STYLE_REFERENCE.txt` — the user's real scene prompts (17 examples). Read before every prompt-writing task.
- `Workflow.docx`, addenda, `FRAME _ TYPES .ink.docx`, `Settings-WPS Office.docx`, `Images—ink.docx` — in `Monkeycode` repo.

## 6 · Delivery rules

- Always provide files as downloadable HTML (and paste raw content in chat when asked).
- Preview links on `*.monkeycode-ai.live` die when the dev VM goes offline — never rely on them as the only copy.
- Push every deliverable to this repo so it is never lost.

## 7 · Current progress — Video ink 4 (famine / clay jar survival story)

Story: famine threat forces a village to move in 10 days; the family packs grain into sealed clay jars; only 3 jars exist so they make more from river clay + water + fire; cave = clay workshop (frames 65–80).

- Source of truth for Batch 1: `BATCH 1 Video ink 4.docx` (corrected beats, repo commit `d44580c`) — NOT the older `Video_ink4_Descriptions_v2.docx`.
- **FULL corrected beats (1–158)**: `Video ink 4 Beats Description (AI continued).docx` — user's own beats 1–82 + my continuation 83–158, then USER CORRECTED 83–158 in Videos repo (2026-08-30). This is now the definitive beats file for Video ink 4. Lessons from user's corrections: match headcount exactly (single stickman where beat says single), no extra characters/actions/expressions not in the beat.
- **Image Prompts (1–158)**: DONE — `deliverables/Video_ink4_ImagePrompts_1-158.html` (scenes ONLY, no masters — user provides character references; characters referenced by name + work: teaching stick figure, father ancient stickman, mother ancient stickman, son stickman, ancient tribe stickman figures, ancient stickman on horse). User adds the "provided in image X" lines themselves. Pushed to memory repo only (NOT Videos). Command wrapper = user's reference format ("MS Paint painted flat clean style , white background. Scene : ..." / env: "MS Paint painted flat clean style . Scene : ... , background: ...").
- **USER APPROVED full file 2026-08-30** ("all is good", "just love it thanks, best work for my content production"). Approved with the correction that image prompts must use SHORT labelling lines with text, NOT "a leader line to text" (long leader lines make a mess).
- Character refs for this video (user's own, reused from previous videos): teacher = #1 (teaching stick figure), father = #2, mother/son = user does himself, village group = "ancient tribe stickman figures", messenger/raiders = "ancient stickman on horse".
- Character Masters (simple style: crude stickman, brown fur cloth, messy hair — NOT premium/ink. logo): embedded at the top of the complete HTML, 6 masters (teaching / father / mother / children / village / raider on horse).
- Batch 1 (Images 1–82): DONE — `Video_ink4_Complete_ImagePrompts_Batch1.html` (masters + all 82 frames in full locked command), built from `/tmp/opencode/batch1_scenes_v4.json` (v4 scenes rebuilt strictly from corrected beats), pushed to `Videos` + `Chat-History-Repo`.
- NOTE: these masters were written BEFORE the user's new rules (name + clothing only, clothing decided by user). They will need REWORK when Batch 1 resumes — wait for the user to choose clothing.
- v3 mistakes fixed in v4: image 41 = heading "FOUR THREATS" + four labeled icons (bowl/sword/cave/beast); 50 = empty bowl icon + "FIRST THREAT"; 63 = small burning stick branch (not campfire); 58 = jar half-finished from clay lump; 72/74/76 = teaching figure one finger "Until" / "Once It's Shaped" / "Then"; 80 = hardened jar placed on a rock inside the cave; 81 = stone icon + text "LIKE STONE"; 82 = both hands open "And Now"; 40 = both hands open raised "There are"; 46 = one finger "And At Last".
- **Batch 3 (Images 132–217): beats are in `FINAL BATCH.docx` (Monkeycode repo) — PENDING, wait for user's Batch 1 test feedback first.**
- NOTE: the masters written earlier (6 crude stickmen with brown fur cloth) were written BEFORE the user's new rules (name + clothing only, clothing decided by user). User confirmed for Video ink 4 they already have teacher + father refs, will do mother/son themselves, and image prompts just reference "ancient tribe stickman figures" and "ancient stickman on horse" by name — so NO masters are generated for this video.
- Style note (user locked): character prompts must be SIMPLE — reject "too much detail," "AI slop," art jargon (cel-shaded / cinematic / vector / flat 2D / rich / painterly / lighting / shadows / glow). Use MS Paint beginner / childish amateur language.

## 7b · Delivery rule — live server preview

- User expects image-prompt files delivered in a live server preview (previous session's preview server is dead), not just chat dumps / file links. Start `python3 -m http.server` (or similar) in the deliverable dir and hand the direct URL. Preview links on `*.monkeycode-ai.live` still die when the VM goes offline — always also push to the repos.

## 8 · Repo layout

- `CONTEXT.md` — this file. Update + push at the end of every task / session.
- `Chat` — full copy of the earlier session's chat export (the source of this context).
- `Chat-2026-08-28-to-2026-09-06.txt` — full export of the Video ink 4 session (user rules on style/masters/beats, corrections, approval).
- `deliverables/` — every generated HTML / text deliverable, saved per video.
- `videos-repo-backup/` — archive of ALL files from the old `Videos` repo (moved here 2026-08-30, then `Videos` repo was emptied for a fresh start).
- **Repos (updated 2026-08-30):**
  - `https://github.com/Bimpo29/INK-CHANNEL-MEMORY.git` — THIS repo. My memory. Formerly `Chat-History-Repo` (renamed). Holds CONTEXT.md + deliverables + archived Videos content.
  - `https://github.com/Bimpo29/Videos.git` — EMPTIED (fresh start, emptied again 2026-08-31). User uploads corrected batches / new scripts here; deliverables no longer pushed here.
  - `https://github.com/Bimpo29/Monkeycode.git` — rulebooks/workflow docs (Workflow.docx, addenda, FRAME _ TYPES .ink.docx, Settings-WPS Office.docx, Images—ink.docx, FINAL BATCH.docx).
- Push every change with `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=0` (the environment injects a broken credential helper; `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=0` disables it, and the repo-local `credential.helper=store` handles auth).
